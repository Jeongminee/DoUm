## Target Users
  Our target users are Korean seniors over the age 75 years old who are neglected from internet technology.

## The Problem

The problem your product will be solving. Explain how your solution will be unique or
different than existing solutions.
Our product is a tutorial website. Users can choose which program or application they want to learn and they can see very detailed instruction. The instructions will include screenshot and diagrams to help users to keep track on, and there will be a pop-up dictionary section incase of users having trouble with understanding some vocabularies. This website is unique because of its accesibility. It only requires users to connect on the internet and open a web browser. 

## Existing Solutions

1) Ask younger family members: It is hard for the family members to explain by a call or message because they are unable to see the screen. Thus, they might not know what the exact problem is, or it can be hard to explain at the senior's level of understanding.
2) IT teaching classes in community centers : The classes might not teach what the seniors want to know and they have to wait until class to find out the solutions. Also, there may be no community centers near by so it can be hard to access.
3) Q&A page: It is difficult to find for seniors and there can be no detailed explanations including screen shots.

## Plan of Research
#### Ask 60s and 70s to know their difficulties when they are using applications or websites.
2) Previously, ask 20s or 10s (who are close to their grandparents and have experience to teach them the way to use applications or websites.) about the applications or websites that grandparents often found difficulties.
3) Ask the people who work in Senior Citizen Welfare Hall.
