## Target Users
Our target users are Korean seniors over the age 75 years old who are neglected from internet technology; especially having difficulty in using applications on smartphones.

## The Problem
Our product is a tutorial website. Users can choose which applications they want to learn and they can see very detailed instructions. The instructions will include screenshot and diagrams to help users to keep track on, and there will be a pop-up dictionary section incase of users having trouble with understanding some vocabularies. This website is unique because of its accesibility. It only requires users to connect on the internet and open a web browser. It is also unique because it deals with applications that **Korean** seniors use frequently and have difficulty using.

## Existing Solutions

### Ask younger family members

It is hard for the family members to explain by a call or message because they are unable to see the screen. Thus, they might not know what the exact problem is, or it can be hard to explain at the senior's level of understanding.

### IT teaching classes in community centers

The classes might not teach what the seniors want to know and they have to wait until class to find out the solutions. Also, there may be no community centers near by so it can be hard to access.

### Q&A page
It is difficult to find for seniors and there can be no detailed explanations including screen shots.

### Existing Tutorial Sites
Although there are existing tutorial sites that explain the use of applications. However, their are no websites where it shows how to use applications **Korean** seniors frequently use. Also, the UI is not targeted for the seniors. We plan on increasing the font size so that seniors can read easily and also including more images than words for easier understanding.
## Plan of Research

#### Interview target users
This method will help our group to identify exact problem our target users are having; which application they want to learn, what function is the most troublesome, anyother features that they would like to have.  
#### Ask target users' children/grandchildren
In most times, our target users ask to their children or grandchildren for technical help. The problem is, they are not avaliable always; thus we are making our product to solve this problem. In other words, they know 

Previously, ask 20s or 10s (who are close to their grandparents and have experience to teach them the way to use applications or websites.) about the applications or websites that grandparents often found difficulties.
3) Ask the people who work in Senior Citizen Welfare Hall.

### Ask Korean Seniors
Ask the Korean seniors how they use their smartphones and which applications they frequently use. Also, ask them whether they had any difficulties when using these applications and also ask them if they want to learn any other features of the smartphone.

### Ask the younger generation
Ask 10s or 20s, who are close to their grandparents if they have had the experience of teaching their grandparents the way of using applications. about the applications or websites that grandparents often found difficulties.

### Ask the people who work in Senior Citizen Welfare Hall.
At the Incheon Senior Culture Center, they hold an continuation education program that teaches the use of computers and smartphones. We plan and calling the center to find out more information about what the seniors learn and what applications they have the most difficulty of using.
