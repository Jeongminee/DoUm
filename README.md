  Jeongmin Yoo(jeongmin.yoo.1@stonybrook.edu
  
2. Target User: Seniors (age above 60) 

3. Our product is a tutorial website. Users can choose which program or application they want to learn and they can see very detailed instruction. The instructions will include screenshot and diagrams to help users to keep track on, and there will be a pop-up dictionary section incase of users having trouble with understanding some vocabularies. This website is unique because of its accesibility. It only requires users to connect on the internet and open a web browser. 

4. 
1) Ask a friend: This is not professional. Your friend can suggest a look that is not your taste. Also, it is difficult to ask every time for your friend to help you out.
2) Professional Coordinator: It is expensive and hard to access.
3) SNS such as Instagram or Pinterest: There are too many ads.
