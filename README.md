2. Target User: Men in their 20~30s. 

3. Our product will recommend wareable outfit picks for men, just with the clothes already in their closet. Users can take pictures of their clothes and upload on our site. Then the program will detect the clothes' fit, colors, and other features into numerous different categories. With these data the program will match the best case for a given case. Our product is different from existing services by not leading users into buying new clothes. Current services are basically online shopping services, but our program only work with existing clotes.

1) Ask a friend: This is not professional. Your friend can suggest a look that is not your taste. Also, it is difficult to ask every time for your friend to help you out.
2) Professional Coordinator: It is expensive and hard to access.
3) SNS such as Instagram or Pinterest: There are too many ads.
